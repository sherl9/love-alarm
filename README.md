README:
This is a social application. Students in UoM can make new friends and chat with each other. The most exciting feature is Love Alarm. If you have a crush but are too shy to express your love, you can set them as your alert in the APP. Whenever you are near your crush, their phone will ring. And if two users set the alarm for each other, they can see their location and profile in the map.

How to run our APP:
1. Open our project in Android Studio.
2. Syncronizing the project with gradle files.
3. Open AVD Manager and create a virtual device with API Level 21+.
4. CLick the run button to build and run our APP.
5. Or you can use your own physical device, but also make sure your API Level is above 21.
6. For the first time you run our APP, please enable the GPS, Audio, Camera and File permmision when it ask you.
